Design stage

## Project Overview
Aim to build a controlled spark gap using a transformer and cockcroft-walton voltage multiplier. Using a small battery, we will generate a time varying waveform to be stepped up using a transformer and then further amplified using a cockcroft-walton circuit.

## Educational Value Added
Reinforced theoretical concepts taught in class. Specifically, the use of oscilators, transformers, DC-DC conversion, and switching.
