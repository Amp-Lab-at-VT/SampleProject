## Project Overview
Aim to build a Cockcroft-Walton circuit with the ability to use a stepped up voltage to rapidly charge parallel capacitor banks. These can then serve as portable power sources to possibly charge batteries over a longer period.

## Educational Value Added
Reinforced theoretical concepts taught in class. Specifically, the use of oscilators, transformers, DC-DC conversion, and switching
